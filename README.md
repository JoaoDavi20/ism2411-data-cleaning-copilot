# ism2411-data-cleaning-copilot

This code is made to organize data, specially by cleaning it, that means removing items/values that do not make sense, but also by making it easier to read.

For this code to work just submit your data into data/raw and run the script data_cleaning.py found in the folder src. After some seconds you will find your data clean in the folder data/processed

Attention! Remember to submit a .csv file as your data!
