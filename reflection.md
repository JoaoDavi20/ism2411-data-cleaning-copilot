I used Copilot to generate a function that would calculate the total profit for each item, by multyplying quantity and price, I also used to create a function that would clean the column names, making them pretiter adn easier to read. For one of the functions I used a comment to creat while the for the other one I just type the name of the function and he was able to understand what I was looking for.

Both functions came out incomplete, the functions were good however they we're not called, so I had to do that mannualy, which was a necessary change otherwise the functions would not work. Also for the function that organized the column names the AI thought it would be better to make them lowercase, so I also changed that because it made it better in my opnion. 

Something that I learned was that AI works much better when there is a human brain behind it. I was very impressed by how precise and fast Copilot was to understand what I was asking, sometimes I felt like it knew what I was going to ask before I even finishing typing one word. However, it is clear that AI also needs revising, just to make sure that everything is doing exactly what is suppossed to be doing, and also that things are being done in the best way possible. For those reasons I would not trust AI to create a huge code from zero, I believe it works best if try to create step by step while you are revising it. In the end of the day, there is need for a human who knows Python.
